Brief overview:
This project describes the software architecture of the PlayStation App and was worked on by a team of four people.
It is a software application for iOS and Android devices that allows us to identify online friends, view progress, 
compare trophies with friends, or create a profile to display to friends and link to PlayStation consoles and video games. 
The first version of the application was released on 11/15/2013.
